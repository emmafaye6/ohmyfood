# Ohmyfood

This is the fourth project for the OpenClassroom course I'm following. The goal for this projet is to create the homepage for a restaurant booking website along with three menu pages. The website needs to be coded in mobile-first and needs to be using only HTML and CSS. There also needs to be some CSS animations as it is the main subject for this course's chapter.
